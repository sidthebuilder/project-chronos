Project CHRONOS — Interface Contracts (Structural Subtyping)

Using typing.Protocol instead of abc.ABC gives us structural subtyping:
any class that implements the required methods satisfies the interface without
inheriting from it.  This keeps test doubles and production implementations
fully decoupled — no base class import needed.

The six contracts map directly to the subsystems described in the paper:
    ICryptographicEngine  →  §3.1  Plaintext Blindness (FHE)
    ITimeLock             →  §3.2  Cryptographic Fuse (PoSW / Hash chain)
    IVDFEngine            →  §3.2  Wesolowski VDF (production replacement)
    IOracleClient         →  §3.3  Dead Man's Switch (drand)
    IMemorySanitizer      →  §3.4  Erasure Protocol (memory wipe)
    ISNARKProver          →  §3.4  SNARK Erasure Attestation (Groth16)

Design note — ISNARKProver and IVDFEngine:
    These two interfaces are STUBS in this prototype.  The paper (§3.3, §3.4)
    specifies Wesolowski VDF over an MPC-generated RSA modulus and a Groth16
    circuit with ~180k constraints.  Both require native Rust/C++ backends
    (bellman, gnark, or arkworks) that have no stable pure-Python bindings.

    Inject the stub implementations (NoopSNARKProver, NoopVDFEngine) during
    development.  Replace with a cffi/ctypes shim to a compiled Rust crate
    for production use.
