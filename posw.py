Project CHRONOS — Proof of Sequential Work (PoSW) Time-Lock (§3.2)

This module implements the Cohen-Pietrzak Proof of Sequential Work that acts
as the "cryptographic fuse" in the CHRONOS architecture.

Background (§2.2 of the paper):
    A PoSW is a function f(x, T) that requires T sequential computational
    steps to evaluate, and whose output can be verified in sub-linear time.
    Unlike proof-of-work (which is parallelisable), PoSW is inherently
    sequential — throwing more cores at it does NOT speed it up.

    CHRONOS uses PoSW to enforce a minimum elapsed wall-clock time before the
    decryption key can be derived.  No shortcut exists on current hardware.

Implementation details:
    - The sequential kernel is a SHA-256 hash chain: h_i = SHA256(h_{i-1}).
    - The chain is split into 1_000 segments of equal length.  The last hash
      of each segment is saved as a "checkpoint" (leaf node).
    - A BINARY MERKLE TREE is built over the 1_000 checkpoints.  Each
      internal node is SHA256(left_child || right_child).  The root is the
      PoSW commitment.  A verifier can spot-check any leaf in exactly
      ceil(log2(1000)) = 10 hash operations using the Merkle inclusion proof
      (sibling path), without replaying the full chain.
    - The chain runs in an isolated subprocess (multiprocessing.Process) so
      the CPU-bound work does not block the asyncio event loop.
    - The key derivation uses HKDF-SHA256 over the Merkle root so that the
      output key is indistinguishable from random even if the internal hash
      chain algorithm is known.

Calibration:
    The PoSW manager auto-calibrates on startup by timing 100_000 hash
    operations and computing how many hashes per second the local CPU achieves.
    It then sets T = hashes_per_second * target_duration_seconds, so that the
    chain takes exactly *target_duration_seconds* of real wall-clock time.

    Calibration drift note (acknowledged in §5.2 of the paper): if the CPU
    frequency changes between calibration and execution (due to thermal
    throttling or power management), the actual duration will vary.  A ±10%
    tolerance is expected and acceptable for the prototype.  Actual elapsed
    time is measured and logged; if drift exceeds 25% a WARNING is emitted.
