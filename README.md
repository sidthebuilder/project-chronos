## What CHRONOS Does

CHRONOS is a research prototype for cryptographic agent containment. It gives an autonomous AI agent three simultaneous guarantees:

1. **Plaintext Blindness** - The agent processes inputs under Fully Homomorphic Encryption and never observes plaintext.
2. **Verifiable Time-Bound Existence** - A Verifiable Delay Function enforces a mission duration that cannot be bypassed through parallelism.
3. **Attestable Software Erasure** - A cryptographic commitment proves the key was destroyed after the deadline.

The goal is structural containment enforced by mathematics, not behavioural alignment.

## Prototype vs. Paper Specification

This is a research prototype. The table below documents where the implementation diverges from the formal paper and why.

| Subsystem | Paper Specification | Current Implementation | Status |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| FHE | TFHE-rs boolean circuits | TFHE-rs FheUint32 (Zama production library) | Production-grade |
| VDF | Wesolowski VDF over MPC RSA modulus | Wesolowski VDF over local RSA modulus | Prototype |
| Erasure Proof | Groth16 SNARK | Arkworks Groth16 over BLS12-381 | Production-grade |
| Modulus Generation | Diogenes MPC | Local hardcoded constants | Stub |
| Time Oracle | drand quicknet chain | drand quicknet chain | Production-grade |
| Memory Erasure | Triple-pass volatile wipe | Triple-pass write_volatile + compiler_fence (Rust) | Production-grade |
| Anti-Tamper | Timing detection daemon | Dedicated OS thread timing daemon | Production-grade |
| P2P Network | - | libp2p Gossipsub + Kademlia DHT | Prototype |

## v2 Changes (July 2026)

### Paper
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Broken ZK compositeness proof (circular reasoning) | Removed. Trust delegated to Diogenes MPC certificate |
| UC theorem had no PPT reductions | All hybrids include explicit adversary constructions B1, B2, B3 |
| Fabricated GPU SNARK timing numbers | Removed. Limitations table added |
| Claimed "new ZK protocol" while also saying "no new primitives" | Removed contradiction; framing corrected to "systematic integration" |

### Code
| File | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `posw.py` | mp.Queue changed to mp.Pipe to fix deadlock on large checkpoint payloads |
| `chronos_agent.py` | Schnorr NIZK correctly labelled as pre-erasure commitment |
| `drand_client.py` | BLS key format corrected for quicknet chain |
| `memory_sanitizer.py` | Wipe verification uses ctypes.string_at |
| `security/anti_tamper.py` | Anomaly threshold raised to 5 consecutive hits |

### Rust Prototype (new in v2)
| Component | What it implements |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `chronos-crypto/fhe.rs` | Production TFHE-rs FheUint32. Homomorphic dot product and matrix-vector multiplication for encrypted neural network inference. |
| `chronos-crypto/vdf.rs` | Wesolowski VDF with evaluate() and verify(). Uses Fiat-Shamir heuristic for the challenge. |
| `chronos-crypto/snark.rs` | Arkworks Groth16 over BLS12-381. Proves knowledge of pre-erasure secret x * y = z. |
| `chronos-crypto/posw.rs` | Pure Rust SHA-256 hash chain PoSW with checkpoint recording and determinism tests. |
| `chronos-core/memory.rs` | SecureString with DoD 5220.22-M triple-pass write_volatile zeroization on Drop. |
| `chronos-core/tamper.rs` | CPU timing anomaly daemon on a dedicated OS thread. Triggers erasure after 5 consecutive drifts. |
| `chronos-net/drand.rs` | Async drand beacon fetch via reqwest. Mixes network randomness with Intel RDRAND hardware entropy. |
| `chronos-net/p2p.rs` | libp2p Gossipsub + Kademlia DHT for decentralised compute task broadcasting. |
| `chronos-agent/main.rs` | Tokio async orchestrator. Full 6-phase agent lifecycle. |

## Security Properties

| Property | Mechanism | Assumption |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Plaintext blindness | TFHE-rs FHE inference | TFHE CPA security |
| Time-bound key access | Wesolowski VDF over RSA modulus | Factoring hardness + VDF sequentiality |
| Erasure attestation | Arkworks Groth16 SNARK over BLS12-381 | Groth16 q-PKE |
| Tamper detection | CPU timing daemon + mlock | OS memory model |

### What CHRONOS Does NOT Guarantee
- Physical erasure against cold-boot or DMA attacks
- Post-quantum security (RSA VDF modulus relies on factoring hardness)
- Erasure if the OS swaps the key to disk before mlock is called

## Installation

### Rust Prototype

Requires Rust stable and the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (Windows) or build-essential (Linux).

```bash
cd chronos-rust
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

### Python Prototype

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
CHRONOS_DISABLE_ANTI_TAMPER=true pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## Running the Rust Agent

```bash
cd chronos-rust
cargo run --bin chronos-agent
```

Expected output:

```
=== CHRONOS RUST AGENT BOOTSTRAP ===
[1/6] Initializing libp2p Decentralized Swarm (Gossipsub + Kademlia)...
[2/6] Fetching Drand randomness beacon...
[3/6] Generating TFHE-rs Production FHE keypair, pinning secret key to secure memory...
[4/6] Fetching Telecom Customer Churn Dataset (7,043 records) over network...
[5/6] Encrypting features and evaluating a 2-Layer Neural Network over TFHE...
[6/6] Spawning Wesolowski VDF time-lock (10k sequential squarings)...
